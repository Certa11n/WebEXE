# Warning
The assembly you are trying to load **must** be made in the same framework as the loader, and same language too (C#).

It's far from being 100% stable, but it works for most tasks.
## Alternative techniques
Use a library that lets you inject a C# DLL and execute a function directly; just on a EXE.
